# NMS-VR-Screenshot-Fix
By default, No Man's Sky VR screenshots appear stretched. By changing their aspect ratio to 1:1 (making them square), the shots look much more natural. To automate this solution, this program makes 1:1 aspect ratio copies of your screenshots.
 
## Download
 The executable jar can be downloaded in the assets of the most recent release: [found here](https://github.com/NoahOrtega/nmsvrscreenshotfix/releases/tag/v1.0)
